                A folding bike is a type of bicycle that is designed to be compact and easy to store, transport, and carry. Folding bikes typically feature a frame that can be folded down to a smaller size, often using a hinge mechanism that allows the bike to be folded in half or in thirds. They are commonly used by commuters, urban dwellers, and travelers who need a convenient and space-saving mode of transportation. Folding bikes can vary in size and weight, with some models weighing as little as 20 pounds and folding down to fit into a small carrying bag. They may feature smaller wheels than traditional bicycles, and often include features such as adjustable handlebars and seats, and gears for better control and speed. Although they may not be as fast or efficient as traditional bicycles, folding bikes offer a practical solution for those who need a compact and portable bike that can be easily stored and transported.
