                <h2 class="content3">Cycling</h2>
                <h3 class="content4">For many people, riding a bicycle was something they did as a kid, but it’s not something they did much of once they got into their teen years. For some, it’s because they got a car and could drive places instead of a bike. For others, it’s because they live in an area where bicycling isn’t an option—those out in rural areas with unpaved roads may not always be able to bike places. But with new inventions such as the electric bike and bicycles that are safer, more and more people are turning to bikes as a way of saving money and going green.</h3>
                
                <h2 class="content3">The History of Cycling</h2>
                <h3 class="content4">Bicycling was first introduced in the 1800s, and it quickly became very popular. However, the basic bicycle design can be traced back to 1493, when Gian Giacomo Caprotti sketched out the idea. Another version was built in France in 1791. However, what many people consider the first practical bicycle was created in 1817 by Karl von Drais, a German civil servant.
                    In 1868, the first documented bicycle race was held. Bikers racked 1,200 meters in the Park of Saint-Cloud in Paris.             
                    In the U.S., bicycles were incredibly popular in the early 1900s. The oldest bicycle racing club, the St. Louis Cycling Club, was established in 1887 and continues to host races and other events today. However, by 1920, the practice of cycling quickly died out because of the automobile and the growth of larger suburbs. In Europe, cycling continued to go strong until the 1950s.               
                    Today, though, more and more people are biking to work as a way of saving on gas, getting exercise, and because it’s fun.</h3>

                <h2 class="content3">Bicycle Improvements</h2>
                <h3 class="content4">The bicycle has undergone many improvements over the years. The bicycle created by Baron Karl von Drais, originally called a the 'draisienne' (which was also known as 'Velocipede', 'Laufmachine', or 'running machine') was similar in design to today’s bike, but it was very, very basic. It was made completely from wood, for example, and it was pushed with the feet instead of pedaled. Pedals weren’t added until 1865 when Ernest Michaux of France modified the bike to include them. This mode, the Michaudine, didn’t use gears, but the front wheel was increased so that the bike traveled farther with each pedal. Two years later, Michaux added brakes to his bike so that it was easier to stop. Chains and gears were added in the 1870s, making it possible to go faster with less effort.
    <br>
                    By the end of the 19th century, the bicycle had evolved into what we know it as today. While improvements have been made since then, they’ve mostly been in the materials used in bike building. However, the e-bike, or electric bicycle, has marked a major change in the biking industry. It’s almost like a motorcycle—a small electric motor powers the bike, making it much easier to cycle to work. However, those who ride for fitness or want to compete in races won’t want this type of bike.</h3>

                <h2 class="content3">Getting Started</h2>
                <h3 class="content4">Getting started in cycling is very easy. All you need to do is own a bike and know how to ride it. Of course, you’ll need safety equipment such as a helmet and, if you’re riding at night, reflective clothing. There are many different bikes out there, so be sure you get one that’s right for you. There are bikes built for racing, off-road riding, and daily cycling, and each is slightly different. Street bikes usually have thinner tires, while off-road mountain bikes have tires that are designed to handle rocks and other debris without puncturing.

                    Once you’ve started cycling, you can either do it on your own, with a few friends, or you can join a cycling group. Look in your local paper, in biking magazines, or online to see if there’s a cycling club in your area.</h3>
