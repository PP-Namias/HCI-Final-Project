                BMX (Bicycle Motocross) is a type of bicycle racing that involves riders competing on small, single-speed bicycles with 20-inch wheels on a closed dirt track with jumps and obstacles. BMX bikes are designed to be lightweight and agile, with a strong, durable frame and components that can withstand the rigors of high-speed jumps and landings. They typically have a single gear and no suspension, with wide, knobby tires for better traction on dirt surfaces. In addition to racing, BMX has also evolved into a popular sport and culture, with riders performing tricks and stunts on street courses, skate parks, and dirt jumps. BMX bikes used for these types of freestyle riding may feature different components and modifications, such as pegs for grinding and a rotor system for performing tricks while the handlebars are spun.
