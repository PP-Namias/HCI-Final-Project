                A gravel bike, also known as an adventure bike or all-road bike, is a type of bicycle that is designed for riding on mixed surfaces, including paved roads, gravel paths, dirt roads, and even mild off-road terrain. Gravel bikes typically feature a lightweight frame similar to a road bike, wider tires with a tread pattern that provides better traction on loose surfaces, a more relaxed geometry for added comfort on longer rides, and drop handlebars that allow for multiple hand positions. They may also include features such as disc brakes for better stopping power in wet and muddy conditions, and mounts for racks and fenders to make them more versatile for longer trips. Gravel bikes are popular among cyclists who enjoy exploring new routes and tackling a variety of terrains, and are often used for bikepacking and touring adventures.
